# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

### Step 1:
Import the necessary libraries and dataset.

### Step 2:
Load the dataset and scale the values for easier computation.

### Step 3:
Add noise to the images randomly for both the train and test sets.

### Step 4:
Build the Neural Model using Convolutional, Pooling and Up Sampling layers. Make sure the input shape and output shape of the model are identical.

### Step 5:
Pass test data for validating manually.

#### Step 6:
Plot the predictions for visualization.
